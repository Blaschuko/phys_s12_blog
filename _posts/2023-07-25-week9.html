<h2 class="text-xl underline">Concept</h2>


<p class="mb-p">For this week's project, I decided to use an ESP32 cam and firebase to try to remotely upload pictures to a firebase database. I will base my work on <a href="https://randomnerdtutorials.com/esp32-cam-save-picture-firebase-storage/" class="link">This tutorial</a>, but will change a lot of things.</p>

<h1 class="text-3xl">THE REST OF THIS POST WILL BE UPLOADED on the 7th of AUGUST (MONDAY), PROBABLY AT NIGHT, BECAUSE I AM STILL WAITING FOR THE ESP32 PROGRAMMER TO SHIP TO MY HOUSE. Sorry!</h1>
