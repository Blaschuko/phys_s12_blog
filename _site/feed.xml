&lt;p class=&quot;mb-p&quot;&gt;The first household object I decided to model was a lamp. My goal is to succesfully model a good-looking lamp without using any tutorials, and therefore test my 3D modeling skills.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;mb-p&quot;&gt;I started modeling the base, which I made with 2 circles (one with a fixed diameter of &lt;span class=&quot;hl&quot;&gt;120 mm&lt;/span&gt;, and the other with a fixed offset of &lt;span class=&quot;hl&quot;&gt;-12.5 mm&lt;/span&gt;). I also added a smaller circle off-center, which is where the arm of the lamp will come out of.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;/phys_s12_blog/assets/images/lampModel/step1.png&quot; class=&quot;img&quot;&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;mb-p&quot;&gt;I then extruded the outer circle &lt;span class=&quot;hl&quot;&gt;30 mm&lt;/span&gt; and the inner circle (without the off-centered circle) &lt;span class=&quot;hl&quot;&gt;20 mm&lt;/span&gt;. To make it look better, I used a fillet with a &lt;span class=&quot;hl&quot;&gt;rolling ball corner type&lt;/span&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;img src=&quot;/phys_s12_blog/assets/images/lampModel/step2.png&quot; class=&quot;img&quot;&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;mb-p italic&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;font-bold&quot;&gt;Side note: &lt;/span&gt; Adding appearances to 3D models can make them look a lot better (even if it&apos;s just a visual thing, it can make modeling much more pleasing). You will find bellow a picture of that same base with a wood appearance, and you&apos;ll notice that it looks a lot better.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;img src=&quot;/phys_s12_blog/assets/images/lampModel/step2wood.png&quot; class=&quot;img2&quot;&gt;


&lt;p class=&quot;mb-p&quot;&gt;I then started to work on the arm. I started by sketching a &lt;span class=&quot;hl&quot;&gt;path&lt;/span&gt;, which will be followed by a &lt;span class=&quot;hl&quot;&gt;profile&lt;/span&gt; (a circle in this case) to create the 3D arm. I created the path using the &lt;span class=&quot;hl&quot;&gt;spline tool&lt;/span&gt; and eyeballing the general shape (it&apos;s really hard to measure curved objects, and I never intended to have an exact replica of my lamp).&lt;/p&gt; 

&lt;img src=&quot;/phys_s12_blog/assets/images/lampModel/step3.png&quot; class=&quot;img2&quot;&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;mb-p&quot;&gt;After finishing the path, I used the &lt;span class=&quot;hl&quot;&gt;sweep tool&lt;/span&gt; to generate a 3D model of the path using the off-cetered hole we sketched earlier as a profile.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;img src=&quot;/phys_s12_blog/assets/images/lampModel/step4.png&quot; class=&quot;img2&quot;&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;mb-p&quot;&gt;The next step was undoubtedly the hardest part of the modeling process: the lampshade. I knew I wanted to do some kind of triangle, but I didn&apos;t know where to start. After taking a look at the different tools Fusion has, I decided to use the &lt;splan class=&quot;hl&quot;&gt;revolve tool&lt;/splan&gt;. The revolve tool replicates a profile along an axis, which is exactly what I needed. I first created a point in the center of the end-part of the arm and created a perpendicular axis between that point and the arm (see image below, it&apos;s pretty hard to explain!). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;img src=&quot;/phys_s12_blog/assets/images/lampModel/step5.png&quot; class=&quot;img2&quot;&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;mb-p&quot;&gt;Using that axis, I created a plane which I used to create a sketch. The sketch is essentially a straight line with a &lt;span class=&quot;hl&quot;&gt;75 degree angle&lt;/span&gt; and a length of &lt;span class=&quot;hl&quot;&gt;70 mm&lt;/span&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;img src=&quot;/phys_s12_blog/assets/images/lampModel/step6.png&quot; class=&quot;img2&quot;&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;mb-p&quot;&gt;Finally, I used the revolve tool to replicate that sketch along the axis we created earlier. I used a &lt;span class=&quot;hl&quot;&gt;360 degree angle&lt;/span&gt; to make a full circle, and therefore have a closed lampshade. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;img src=&quot;/phys_s12_blog/assets/images/lampModel/finished.png&quot; class=&quot;img2&quot;&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;text-lg mb-[5%]&quot;&gt;If you want to take a look at the design, you can download the &lt;a href=&quot;/phys_s12_blog/assets/stl/lamp-stl.stl&quot; class=&quot;link&quot;&gt;.stl file&lt;/a&gt; or the Fusion360 &lt;a href=&quot;/phys_s12_blog/assets/stl/lamp-f3d.f3d&quot; class=&quot;link&quot;&gt;.f3d file&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2 class=&quot;text-xl underline&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2)&lt;/strong&gt; Modeling a pencil sharpener&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;mb-p&quot;&gt;The second object I&apos;m going to model is a pencil sharpener. This time, I will try to replicate my real pencil sharpener as accurately as possible. That is why I&apos;m going to use a caliper, which I strongly encourage anyone who wants to accurately model something to use.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;img src=&quot;/phys_s12_blog/assets/images/sharpenerModel/caliper.jpg&quot; class=&quot;img2&quot;&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;mb-p&quot;&gt;After taking a few measurements (you will find the measurements bellow) I sketched a simple top-down view of the sharpener.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;mb-p text-center&quot;&gt;
    &lt;img src=&quot;/phys_s12_blog/assets/images/sharpenerModel/measurement1.jpg&quot; class=&quot;inline-block mr-[3%] mb-[1%] w-[25%]&quot;&gt;
    &lt;img src=&quot;/phys_s12_blog/assets/images/sharpenerModel/measurement2.jpg&quot; class=&quot;inline-block mr-[3%] mb-[1%] w-[25%]&quot;&gt;
    &lt;img src=&quot;/phys_s12_blog/assets/images/sharpenerModel/measurement3.jpg&quot; class=&quot;inline-block mb-[1%] w-[25%]&quot;&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;mb-p2 text-center&quot;&gt;    
        &lt;p class=&quot;inline-block text-center mr-[3%] w-[25%] hl&quot;&gt;32.5 mm&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p class=&quot;inline-block text-center mr-[3%] w-[25%] hl&quot;&gt;37.6 mm&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p class=&quot;inline-block text-center w-[25%] hl&quot;&gt;39.1 mm&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;img src=&quot;/phys_s12_blog/assets/images/sharpenerModel/topdownsketch.png&quot; class=&quot;w-[35%] mx-auto&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;mb-p italic text-right mx-auto w-[35%]&quot;&gt;Top-down sketch&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;mb-p&quot;&gt;I then did the same thing from a side-view. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;mb-p2 text-center&quot;&gt;
    &lt;img src=&quot;/phys_s12_blog/assets/images/sharpenerModel/measurement4.jpg&quot; class=&quot;inline-block mr-[3%] mb-[1%] w-[35%]&quot;&gt;
    &lt;img src=&quot;/phys_s12_blog/assets/images/sharpenerModel/measurement5.jpg&quot; class=&quot;inline-block mr-[3%] mb-[1%] w-[35%]&quot;&gt;
    &lt;p class=&quot;inline-block text-center mr-[3%] w-[35%] hl&quot;&gt;21.47 mm ≈ 21.5 mm&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p class=&quot;inline-block text-center mr-[3%] w-[35%] hl&quot;&gt;25.69 mm ≈ 25.7 mm&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;text-center&quot;&gt;
    &lt;img src=&quot;/phys_s12_blog/assets/images/sharpenerModel/sidesketch.png&quot; class=&quot;inline-block w-[45%] mr-[5%]&quot;&gt;
    &lt;img src=&quot;/phys_s12_blog/assets/images/sharpenerModel/step1.png&quot; class=&quot;inline-block w-[45%]&quot;&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;mb-p italic text-right w-[43%]&quot;&gt;Side sketch&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;mb-p&quot;&gt;Now that we have this basic sketch, we can begin to create more detailed lines in the two different sketches and then extrude them to create a 3D model.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;img src=&quot;/phys_s12_blog/assets/images/sharpenerModel/modelingvideo.gif&quot; class=&quot;mb-p w-[75%] mx-auto&quot;&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;mb-p&quot;&gt;We can then join the two ellipses we just created using the &lt;span class=&quot;hl&quot;&gt;loft tool&lt;/span&gt;, which &lt;span class=&quot;italic&quot;&gt;&quot;creates a transitional shape shape between two or more sketch profiles or planar faces&quot;. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;img src=&quot;/phys_s12_blog/assets/images/sharpenerModel/step2.png&quot; class=&quot;img&quot;&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;mb-p&quot;&gt;I then went back to the back-side sketch and added two circles with the dimensions I got using the caliper&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;mb-p text-center &quot;&gt;
    &lt;img src=&quot;/phys_s12_blog/assets/images/sharpenerModel/measurement6.jpg&quot; class=&quot;inline-block mr-[3%] mb-[1%] w-[35%]&quot;&gt;
    &lt;img src=&quot;/phys_s12_blog/assets/images/sharpenerModel/measurement7.jpg&quot; class=&quot;inline-block mr-[3%] mb-[1%] w-[35%]&quot;&gt;
    &lt;p class=&quot;inline-block text-center mr-[3%] w-[35%] hl&quot;&gt;11.34 mm ≈ 11.3 mm&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p class=&quot;inline-block text-center mr-[3%] w-[35%] hl&quot;&gt;8.1 mm&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;/phys_s12_blog/assets/images/sharpenerModel/step3.png&quot; class=&quot;img&quot;&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;mb-p&quot;&gt;To create the hole, I started by creating an offset plane from those two circles with a distance of &lt;span class=&quot;hl&quot;&gt;15 mm&lt;/span&gt;. I created a sketch on that plane, projected the two circles we just created, and then created two new circles with an offset of &lt;span class=&quot;hl&quot;&gt;-4 mm&lt;/span&gt; for the big circle and &lt;span class=&quot;hl&quot;&gt;-2.5 mm&lt;/span&gt; for the smaller one. We can now use the same tool we used before, loft, to reproduce the same effect we used earlier, but this time to cut into our existing model.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;img src=&quot;/phys_s12_blog/assets/images/sharpenerModel/step4.png&quot; class=&quot;img&quot;&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;mb-p&quot;&gt;To make it look better, I used the &lt;span class=&quot;hl&quot;&gt;fillet tool&lt;/span&gt; to round the edges and added a black material to the model. We could add even more detail to the ouside of the pencil sharpener (some lines and depth) but I don&apos;t think it is worth, given that we would re-use the tools used in this model and the previous one. You&apos;ll find an image of the finished version bellow, along with some links to download the file in case you want to use/modify the model.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;mb-p&quot;&gt;Laser cutting is an extremely useful technique to cut simple materials, such as cardboard. This week, we learned how to operate a laser cutter and we were assigned to create a press-fit construction. To accomplish this, I decided to use a CAD software called Fusion360. I already had experience using it, and the only way to do parametric accurate modeling in the other software option, Blender, is by using the addon &lt;a class=&quot;link&quot; href=&quot;https://www.cadsketcher.com/&quot;&gt;CAD Sketcher&lt;/a&gt;. CAD Sketcher is an extremely new tool, and while it is true it has a huge community supporting it, I don&apos;t think that it has enough features to be used in big projects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;mb-p&quot;&gt;After choosing which software I was going to use, I modeled some simple press-fit squares to know how much material the laser burns when cutting through cardboard. This is called laser kerf. I found out that a good value for the laser kerf was &lt;span class=&quot;hl&quot;&gt;0.8 mm&lt;/span&gt;, which is less than I expected it to be. This meant I had to make my press-fit joints smaller than I initially thought.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;img src=&quot;/phys_s12_blog/assets/images/pressfittest.jpg&quot; class=&quot;mb-[1%] inline-block max-h-[432px] w-[49%]&quot; alt=&quot;Picture of two press-fit cardboard squares&quot;&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;mb-p&quot;&gt;As you can probably see in the joints, the cardboard is slightly bent, and I had to do some force to get them to fit together. While that can be good for long-lasting designs, it is not what I&apos;m looking for. After disassembling and assembling it a few times, the cardboard would probably break. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Later on, I started thinking about what kind of press-fit &quot;structure&quot; I was going to create. At first, I thought about doing something like a puzzle, but then I decided to go for something much more unique: the Eiffel Tower. I looked up some sketches online and decided to start modeling.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class=&quot;text-xl mt-[30px] underline&quot;&gt;Modeling&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;mb-p&quot;&gt;The first thing I did was to search online for a reference image. I don&apos;t intend the model to be identical to the real Eiffel Tower, but I do expect it to look alike.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://www.wikihow.com/Draw-the-Eiffel-Tower&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;img&quot; src=&quot;/phys_s12_blog/assets/images/eiffeltowersketch.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;mb-p&quot;&gt;I then began to think about how I could join the different parts of the structure. The best idea I came up with was to cut 4 separate &quot;legs&quot;, and then join all four of them using press-fit squares placed in between them. I used splines to model the legs, which made designing them really easy. You can see the layout of the design below. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;/phys_s12_blog/assets/images/eiffeltowerlayout.png&quot; class=&quot;img&quot;&gt;

&lt;h2 class=&quot;text-xl underline&quot;&gt;Laser Cutting&lt;/h2&gt; 

&lt;p class=&quot;mb-p&quot;&gt;After finishing the design, I exported the sketch as a &lt;span class=&quot;hl&quot;&gt;.dxf&lt;/span&gt; file and loaded it into the laser cutter&apos;s computer using an SD card. The next step was to send it to the actual laser cutter, and then finally, chose the point in space where it should start cutting (to avoid cutting outside the cardboard, which would be a pretty bad thing!). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;mb-p italic text-right w-[50%] mx-auto&quot;&gt;Picture of the laser cutter&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;mb-p&quot;&gt;The moment I got the pieces out of the laser cutter, I realized that I should have made the design bigger. I designed the model to be &lt;span class=&quot;hl&quot;&gt;22 cm&lt;/span&gt; tall, which I thought would be a good height, but I quickly realized that having small values means having tiny amounts of material near the joints. The joints are therefore quite fragile. Nevertheless, everything fitted perfectly and the design turned out exactly like I wanted it to be.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class=&quot;text-xl underline&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By working on this project, I learned how to use a laser cutter, deepened my CAD skills, and &lt;span class=&quot;hl&quot;&gt;visited Paris&lt;/span&gt;! Next time, I will make larger designs and make sure there is enough material near the joints so the structure can be as strong as possible.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">Concept Laser cutting is an extremely useful technique to cut simple materials, such as cardboard.

&lt;p class=&quot;mb-p&quot;&gt;This site was created with the help of a static site generator: &lt;strong&gt;Jekyll&lt;/strong&gt;. Static site generators are really useful when content looks similar, which is exactly the case of a blog. That is why I decided to use Jekyll for this project. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;mb-p&quot;&gt;To style the site, I&apos;m using &lt;a href=&quot;https://tailwindcss.com&quot; class=&quot;link&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;TailwindCSS&lt;/a&gt;, which a css framework that is extremely useful for rapidly building a good-looking website. It works pretty much like a modern version of bootstrap. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;mb-p&quot;&gt;I think that the most interesting development choice of this project is using &lt;strong&gt;Github Actions&lt;/strong&gt; to compile and deploy the website. I had never used Github Actions, but there are many useful ressources online to learn how to use them. This Github feature allows you to quickly setupt actions to do things such as, in this case, automate the Jekyll build of my website. You&apos;ll find bellow a picture of what an &quot;action&quot; looks like. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;/phys_s12_blog/assets/images/githubactions.png&quot; alt=&quot;Screenshot of a Github Action&quot;&gt;


&lt;h2 class=&quot;text-xl mt-[30px] underline&quot;&gt;Final Project Idea #1&lt;/h2&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;My first idea for the final project is to design a &lt;strong&gt;thrust vector control (TVC) &lt;/strong&gt; mount for model rockets. TVC allows rockets to change the direction of its thrust, and therefore its flight trajectory.&lt;/p&gt;

    
&lt;div class=&quot;mx-auto w-fit mb-p&quot;&gt;
    &lt;a href=&quot;https://bps.space/&quot; class=&quot;inline-block&quot;&gt;
        &lt;img src=&quot;/phys_s12_blog/assets/images/tvcexample.jpg&quot; class=&quot;inline-block&quot;&gt; 
        &lt;p class=&quot;text-sm&quot;&gt;3D model of a TVC mount made by &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/@BPSspace&quot; class=&quot;text-blue-400 underline&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt; bps.space&lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To achieve a successfull project, I would need to succesfully develop a gimbal capable of holding a model rocket thruster, and a flight computer capable of detecting the orientation of the rocket (and therefore corret the trajectory).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class=&quot;text-xl mt-[30px] underline&quot;&gt;Final Project Idea #2&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My second final project idea is to design and build a &lt;strong&gt;3D printed RC car&lt;/strong&gt;. This project would require a lot of material testing (to make sure the different parts of the car are strong enough to sustain high speeds), and a lot of research to find the right components. 
    That is I&apos;m more inclined to pursue my first idea, which would only require simple components (such as servos).&lt;/p&gt;

This Github feature allows you to quickly setupt actions to do things such as, in this case, automate the Jekyll build of my website.
