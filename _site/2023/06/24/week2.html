        <h2 class="text-xl mb-12">24th June 2023</h2>

        <h2 class="text-xl underline">Concept</h2>
<p class="mb-p">Laser cutting is an extremely useful technique to cut simple materials, such as cardboard. This week, we
    learned how to operate a laser cutter and we were assigned to create a press-fit construction. To accomplish this, I
    decided to use a CAD software called Fusion360. I already had experience using it, and the only way to do parametric
    accurate modeling in the other software option, Blender, is by using the addon <a class="link"
        href="https://www.cadsketcher.com/">CAD Sketcher</a>. CAD Sketcher is an extremely new tool, and while it is
    true it has a huge community supporting it, I don't think that it has enough features to be used in big projects.
</p>
<p class="mb-p">After choosing which software I was going to use, I modeled some simple press-fit squares to know how
    much material the laser burns when cutting through cardboard. This is called laser kerf. I found out that a good
    value for the laser kerf was <span class="hl">0.8 mm</span>, which is less than I expected it to be. This meant I
    had to make my press-fit joints smaller than I initially thought.</p>

        href="/phys_s12_blog/assets/stl/press-fit-stl.stl">.STL File</a></p>
<p class="mb-p">As you can probably see in the joints, the cardboard is slightly bent, and I had to do some force to get
    them to fit together. While that can be good for long-lasting designs, it is not what I'm looking for. After
    disassembling and assembling it a few times, the cardboard would probably break. </p>
<p>Later on, I started thinking about what kind of press-fit "structure" I was going to create. At first, I thought
    about doing something like a puzzle, but then I decided to go for something much more unique: the Eiffel Tower. I
    looked up some sketches online and decided to start modeling.</p>

<h2 class="text-xl mt-[30px] underline">Modeling</h2>

<p class="mb-p">The first thing I did was to search online for a reference image. I don't intend the model to be
    identical to the real Eiffel Tower, but I do expect it to look alike.</p>

<a target="_blank" href="https://www.wikihow.com/Draw-the-Eiffel-Tower"><img class="inline-block w-[50%] mb-p"
        src="/phys_s12_blog/assets/images/eiffeltowersketch.jpg"></a>

<p class="mb-p">I then began to think about how I could join the different parts of the structure. The best idea I came
    up with was to cut 4 separate "legs", and then join all four of them using press-fit squares placed in between them.
    I used splines to model the legs, which made designing them really easy. You can see the layout of the design below.

<h2 class="text-xl underline">Laser Cutting</h2>

<p class="mb-p">After finishing the design, I exported the sketch as a <span class="hl">.dxf</span> file and loaded it
    into the laser cutter's computer using an SD card. The next step was to send it to the actual laser cutter, and then
    finally, chose the point in space where it should start cutting (to avoid cutting outside the cardboard, which would
    be a pretty bad thing!). </p>

<p class="mb-p">The moment I got the pieces out of the laser cutter, I realized that I should have made the design
    bigger. I designed the model to be <span class="hl">22 cm</span> tall, which I thought would be a good height, but I
    quickly realized that having small values means having tiny amounts of material near the joints. The joints are
    therefore quite fragile. Nevertheless, everything fitted perfectly and the design turned out exactly like I wanted
    it to be.</p>

<h2 class="text-xl underline">Conclusion</h2>
<p>By working on this project, I learned how to use a laser cutter, deepened my CAD skills, and <span class="hl">visited
        Paris</span>! Next time, I will make larger designs and make sure there is enough material near the joints so
    the structure can be as strong as possible.</p>
