        <h2 class="text-xl underline">Website technology</h2> 
<p>This site was created with the help of a static site generator: <strong>Jekyll</strong>. Static site generators are really useful when content looks similar, which is exactly the case of a blog. That is why I decided to use Jekyll for this project. </p>
</br>
To style the site, I'm using <a href="https://tailwindcss.com" class="text-blue-400 underline" target="_blank">TailwindCSS</a>, which a css framework that is extremely useful for rapidly building a good-looking website. It works pretty much like a modern version of bootstrap. 

<h2 class="text-xl mt-[30px] underline">Final Project Idea #1</h2> 
<p>My first idea for the final project is to design a <strong>thrust vector control mount </strong> (TVC) for model rockets. TVC allows rockets to change the direction of its thrust, and therefore its flight trajectory.</p>
<a href="https://bps.space/"><img src="/assets/images/tvcexample.jpg" class="inline"> </a> <p class="text-sm">3D model of a TVC mount made by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@BPSspace" class="text-blue-400 underline" target="_blank">bps.space</a></p>

<br>
<p>To achieve a successfull project, I would need to succesfully develop a gimbal capable of holding a model rocket thruster, and a flight computer capable of detecting the orientation of the rocket (and therefore corret the trajectory).</p>

<h2 class="text-xl mt-[30px] underline">Final Project Idea #2</h2>

<p>My second final project idea is to design and build a <strong>3D printed RC car</strong>. This project would require a lot of material testing (to make sure the different parts of the car are strong enough to sustain high speeds), and a lot of research to find the right components. 
    That is I'm more inclined to pursue my first idea, which would only require simple components (such as servos).</p>
