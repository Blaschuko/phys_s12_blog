<h2 class="text-xl underline">Choosing an output device</h2>


<p class="mb-p">The first part of this week's assignment is to choose and use an output device using a microcontroller.
  My <a href="/phys_s12_blog/finalproject.html" class="link">final project</a> requires some way to show its
  status in realtime to the user, so I decided to try to use an RGB LED. </p>

<img class="w-[50%] mb-p" src="/phys_s12_blog/assets/images/rgb_config.png">

<p class="mb-p">This image shows us that the longest leg is the common ground, the first leg corresponds to red, the
  third one to blue, and the fourth to green.</p>
<p class="mb-p">As many probably know, the color blue has a higher wavelength than red and green. This means the LED
  needs more energy to emit that color. This is why if we use the same resistance values for each color, you will notice
  that the blue will be a lot fainter than the red. I used a 1000 ohm resistor for the red and green leg (you could use
  a lower value for the green too, but I don't think it makes that much of a difference), and a 500 ohm resistor for the
  blue leg.</p>
<p class="mb-p">I wired everything up in the same breadboard I used in the <a href="/phys_s12_blog/2023/07/17/week6.html"
    target="_blank" class="link">previous assignment</a> to be able to combine the MPU6050 and the RGB LED to make
  something
  interesting, but we'll get to that in a bit. After everything was wired, I set the pin where the RED leg was
  connected HIGH to see if it was working:</p>
<img class="w-[50%] mb-p" src="/phys_s12_blog/assets/images/RGBledWired.png">

<p class="mb-p">As you can see, the LED is working as expected. I then decided to try to make it change colors using
  3 loops. The program goes through each possible value for blue (0-255), and then increments the green by one and does
  the blue loop all over again. When the green reaches 256, it goes back to 0 and red increases by one, starting the
  whole loop again. This technically goes through each possible color, but what I did not think about is the amount of
  possible colors we can "make" using an RGB light. Each channel (red, green, blue) can go from 0 to 255, so each has
  256 possible values, if we do the math, it turns out that the total amount of combination equals 255^3 which is equal
  to 16,777,216. If we stayed in one color for 10 miliseconds before switching to the next one, it would take us 0.001 *
  16777216 = 167772.16 seconds, or 46.6 hours to see every color. I do not intend to stare a tiny RGB Led for nearly 2
  days with no breaks, so I was going to have to do something different.</p>

<p class="mb-p">I found some code online which had an array of "key" rainbow colors, so I modified for it to work with
  my setup and ran it:</p>

<h2 class="text-xl underline">Combining input and output</h2>

<p class="mb-p">After playing around with the LED, I decided to use it to make something that is actually useful. I had
  the MPU6050 already wired, so I fixed upon an inclinometer, or tilt sensor. My idea was to make a device that turns
  green when is on a 0 degree angle (parallel to the floor), yellow when in a small angle, and red when very far from
  perfect. I had wired the input and output devices in the same breadboard, so all that was left to do was the
  software-side of the device. </p>

<p class="mb-p">I started by making a class to control the rgb led, and then used the code from the last post to get the
  angle. Here is the full program:</p>

<p class="mb-p">If you are actually interested in the code, I think that the most interesting part is in the loop. Be
  aware that you won't find anything too complex or exciting. </p>
<p class="mb-p">It turns out that the "device" works perfectly, and is very fun to play around with:</p>

<h2 class="text-xl underline">Using an oscilloscope</h2>

<p class="mb-p">The output from each pin that is connected to the LED (except the ground pin) should be a PWM (pulse
  width modulation) signal, as we're using a value from 0-255 to change the brightness of each color. I wanted to see
  what that signal looked like, so I connected the oscilloscope probes to the fourth leg of the LED, which corresponds
  to green. I chose that leg because it should only be turned on when the angle of the MPU6050 is less than 30 degrees,
  so I will be able to "turn the signal on and off" by just tilting the whole thing. </p>

  allowfullscreen></iframe>

<p class="mb-p">As you can see, when the device is parallel to the table, the signal doesn't show up. However, when I
  turn it slighly, we can wee a pattern that corresponds to a PWM signal. We know that because it isn't HIGH or LOW, but
  rather changes between the two very quickly. PWM works but switching between HIGH and LOW in a very specific time
  domain to create a specific signal. </p>
