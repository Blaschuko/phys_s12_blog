        <h2 class="text-xl underline">Idea and objectives</h2> 
<p class="mb-p">This week we learned about <strong>Motors</strong>, <strong>Electronics</strong>, and <strong>Microcontrollers</strong>. To create something using all of those new concepts, I decided to create a water fountain. I knew from the begining it wasn't going to be an easy task, but I encountered a lot more problems than I initially expected.</p>

<p class="font-bold">The main challenges of this project are: </p>
<ul class="ml-[5%] mb-p list-disc">
    <li>Fabricating a watertight container</li>
    <li>Controlling and using a water pump</li>
    <li>Ataching the different parts of the project (water container, pump, electronics, etc)</li>
</ul>

<p class="mb-p">I started by drawing some sketches. I drew a boat-like shape, and a small structure on top of it which holds a small water pump (which I had found in the lab last week). I added some dimensions to have an idea of how the thing would actually look, and then modeled it with Fusion360.</p>

<p class="mb-p">The main idea is to have an <span class="hl">acrylic base</span> (with a boat-like shape) that can serve as a water container. A secondary <span class="hl">smaller base</span> would hold a <span class="hl">water pump</span> in place, along with all the required electronics (<span class="hl">esp32, batteries, motor driver</span>). The two bases will be attached with <span class="hl">two aluminum rods</span> and <span class="hl">M6 screws</span> (more on that later). </p>
<h2 class="text-xl mt-[30px] underline">Prototyping</h2>
<p class="mb-p">After finishing the CAD model, I laser-cutted the whole thing with cardboard to make sure everything would fit correctly, as I didn't want to waste acrylic. It was important to test if the water pump holder fitted, if the container dimension's were decent, and have a rough idea of how the fountain would look in real life. </p>

<p class="mb-p">I then decided to use a highly advanced chemical compound to join all the pieces together: <span class="hl">hot glue</span>.</p>
<img class="w-[50%] mb-p" src="/phys_s12_blog/assets/images/fountainproto.jpg">   

<p class="mb-p">The next step was to join the two "bases". As I said earlier, we are going to use aluminum rods. The problem is that the lab only had very long aluminum rods. I therefore had to cut one in half to create two smaller ones using a hand saw.</p>

<img class="w-[50%] mb-p" src="/phys_s12_blog/assets/images/fountainrods.jpg">

<p class="mb-p">The next challenge was to figure out how to attach the rods to the top-base (which holds the water pump and the electronics). Last week we were taught how to thread the inside of a hole, and the rods I'm using happen to be hollow, so I used a M6 screw drill tip to thread the end of each aluminum rod. Finding a fitting screw was quite a challenge, and I ended up switching to the imperial system to find an appropiate screw (I basically went through every single screw in the lab to find the right one).</p>

<p class="mb-p">I finally laser-cutted the structure in acrylic, clamped it together, and glued it with epoxy. After waiting approximately 30 minutes, I glued the "ramp" to the rest of the structure, which was impossible to do before the rest of the structure was glued together.</p>

<img class="w-[50%] mb-p" src="/phys_s12_blog/assets/images/fountainclamps.jpg">

<p class="mb-p">The last step is to assemble all the electronics. The design is pretty simple, as most of the complexity will be software-side. 3 AA Batteries are connected to the 4.5V (1.5V each battery) and GND pins of an ESP32. The ESP32 controls a L9110 motor driver with the pins 12 and 13 (the motor driver is also connected to 4.5v and GND). Finally, than motor driver is connected to the water pump  with two small terminals. To keep things simple (and mainly due to a lack of time), I zip tied all the components.</p>
