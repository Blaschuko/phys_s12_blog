        <p class="mb-p">Modern rockets don't have fins but they still manage to point up and remain stable during ascent
            but, how? The answer is <strong>Thrust Vector Control</strong>, or <span class="hl">TVC</span> for short.
            TVC is a system that with the help of a gimbal, rotates an engine on two axis, <span class="hl">pitch</span>
            and <span class="hl">yaw</span>.</p>
        <img class="w-[50%] mb-p" src="/phys_s12_blog/assets/images/rocketrotations.png">

        <p class="mb-p">While we I don't have the time, nor the experience, nor the resources to build a real TVC
            system, there is a very interesting field called <span class="hl">Model Rockets</span>. Model Rockets are
            small hobbyist rockets that can actually fly (sometimes <a
                href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fxuscNM-GE" target="_blank" class="link">REALLY high!</a>) thanks
            to small-scale solid rocket engines. There are many companies that sell them, such as <a
                href="https://estesrockets.com/" class="link">Estes</a> or <a href="https://aerotech-rocketry.com/"
                class="link">AeroTech</a>.</p>

        <p class="mb-p">Before getting started, we need to define the base size parameters for our project. For that, we
            need to chose which motor we will hypotetically chose. We'll assume that the TVC system we create will be
            quite heavy (200 grams or maybe even more), you will understand why when we discuss the different components
            we need. Medium to large engines have a diameter of <span class="hl">24 mm</span> according to Estes, so
            that is the measurement that we will build our TVC around.</p>
