        <h2 class="text-2xl bold underline">Idea</h2>
        <p class="mb-p">Modern rockets don't have fins but they still manage to point up and remain stable during ascent
            but, how? The answer is <strong>Thrust Vector Control</strong>, or <span class="hl">TVC</span> for short.
            TVC is a system that with the help of a gimbal, rotates an engine on two axis, <span class="hl">pitch</span>
            and <span class="hl">yaw</span>.</p>
        <img class="w-[50%] mb-p" src="{{'/assets/images/rocketrotations.png' | relative_url}}">

        <p class="mb-p">While we I don't have the time, the experience, nor the resources to build a real TVC
            system, there is a very interesting "field" called <span class="hl">Model Rockets</span>. Model Rockets are
            small hobbyist rockets that can actually fly (sometimes <a
                href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fxuscNM-GE" target="_blank" class="link">REALLY high!</a>) thanks
            to small-scale solid rocket engines. There are many companies that sell them, such as <a
                href="https://estesrockets.com/" class="link">Estes</a> or <a href="https://aerotech-rocketry.com/"
                class="link">AeroTech</a>. My goal is therefore to build a Thrust Vector Control system/mount in a
            model-rocket scale, hopefully before the end of the class.</p>

        <p class="mb-p">Before getting started, we need to define the base size parameters for our project. For that, we
            need to chose which motor we will hypotetically chose. We'll assume that the TVC system we create will be
            quite heavy (200 grams or maybe even more), you will understand why when we discuss the different components
            we need. Medium to large engines have a diameter of <span class="hl">24 mm</span> according to Estes, so
            that is the measurement that we will build our TVC around.</p>

        <h2 class="text-2xl bold underline">Components</h2>

        <p class="mb-p">We will divide our TVC into two separate main parts to make the designing process easier:</p>

        <h3 class="text-xl bold">Gimbal</h3>
        <p class="mb-p">The gimbal is the part that will rotate the engine. It will be composed of two parts, the
            <span class="hl">outer</span> and the <span class="hl">inner gimbal</span>. The outer gimbal will
            rotate on the <span class="hl">pitch</span>(Y) axis, and the inner gimbal will rotate on the <span
                class="hl">yaw</span> (X) axis. The inner gimbal will be attached to the engine, and the outer gimbal
            will
            be attached to the rocket body. We will need one servo for each gimbal.
        </p>

        <h3 class="text-xl bold">Electronics</h3>

        <p class="mb-p">To control all of our different electronics we will use an ESP32. The ESP32 is much more poweful
            than arduino, and this project needs high response times to accurately correct the trajectory of our rocket.
            The microcontroller needs to control two servos and read the data from a sensor, from which we will get the
            orientation of the rocket. </p>

        <p class="mb-p">The sensor we are going to use is an <span class="hl">MPU6050</span>. I've worked with it <a
                href="{% post_url 2023-07-17-week6 %}" class="link">in the past</a>, and it's a very capable IMU. </p>

        <h2 class="text-2xl bold underline">BOM (bill of materials)</h2>
        <ul class="list-disc mb-p ml-[3%]">
            <li>ESP32</li>
            <li>3D printing filament</li>
            <li>x2 Micro Servo</li>
            <li>Wires</li>
            <li>MPU6050</li>
            <li>M2 & M3 Screws (many lengths)</li>
            <li>M2 & M3 Threaded inserts</li>
        </ul>




        <h2 class="text-2xl bold underline">Design</h2>

        <p class="mb-p">The first idea I had for the gimbal was a three circle design, in which the outer cercle is
            stationary (attached to the rocket) and the other two circles move in different axis. The sketch below
            illustrates the design I had in mind: </p>

        <img class="w-[50%] mb-p" src="{{'/assets/images/gimballsketch.jpg' | relative_url}}">

        <p class="mb-p">I quickly discarded this idea, as the <span class="hl">diameter of the TVC would've ended up
                being really big in respect to the size of the motor</span>, which is something unrealistic that could
            never fly. </p>

        <p class="mb-p">I then started scouting the internet for ideas. <a
                href="https://kassialove.github.io/PS70-assignments/" class="link">Kassia</a> (TA) suggested a very
            interesting mechanism called a <span class="hl">Spherical Parallel Manipulator</span>. As you can see in <a
                href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soWiX1eqZq0" class="link">this video</a>, the device has 3 degrees
            of rotational freedom, so it can also rotate in the roll axis. Our rocket only needs 2 degrees of freedom,
            and adding that third one adds quite a lot of challenges as you can see in the video, so this solution was
            too "advanced" for our needs. Then, I tried looking at people who had done TVC mounts before, to have an idea of what type of gimbal they used.</p>
